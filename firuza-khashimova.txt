Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        From Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9189810/css-display-inline-vs-inline-block
        An inline element has no line break before or after it, and it tolerates HTML elements next to it.
        A block element has some whitespace above and below it and does not tolerate any HTML elements next to it.
        An inline-block element is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block element.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        A. It uses the screen edge as a reference (top-left I beleive), and does not respond to other content. Seemingly bringing it
            forward a layer.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        A. By specifying dimensions as a percentage, rather than fixed pixel length dimension.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        A. Display: block = <div><h1-h6><p><form><header><footer><section>
        B. Display: Inline = <span><a><img>
        C. Display: inline-block = <nav>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        A. The box model refers to the spacing dimensions regarding an HTML element. All HTML elements can be influenced by height,
        width, border, padding, margin. Combined, these 5 dimensions are an element's box. These dimensions can be manipulated and 
        formatted to compliment the design of the website (in CSS). 
            The box model however runs into various issues, with different internet browsers overwriting these box-dimensions if they 
        are not specified, which leads to elements overlapping for instance (all to varying degrees as the browsers have their own 
        defaults). A fix for this is to declare box-sizing in the univeral selector. That way, issues regarding the box level will be 
        laregly avoided.
